# School District Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
-- insert purpose here later --

## Results

* How is the district summary affected?
<br />*District Summary - Module DataFrame*
![module_district_summary](/Resources/district_summary_df_module.PNG)

<br />*District Summary - Adjusted DataFrame*
![adjusted_district_summary](/Resources/district_summary_df_adjusted.PNG)
<br />Ultimately, the district summary didn't see that much of an impact. There was a slight decrease in averages scores for math and reading, and in the percentage of students who passed, but because the students that were removed from the data were such a small piece of the dataset, its impact on a general level was small.
<br /><br />
* How is the school summary affected?
<br />*School Summary - Module DataFrame*
![module_per_school_summary](/Resources/per_school_summary_df_module.PNG)

<br />*School Summary - Adjusted DataFrame*
![adjusted_per_school_summary](/Resources/per_school_summary_df_adjusted.PNG)
<br/>Slight decrease in math score, slight increase in reading score, decrease in passing math, decrease in passing reading, decrease in passing overall
<br /><br />
* How does replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores affect Thomas High School's performance relative to the other schools?
<br />*Top Schools - Module DataFrame*
![module_top_schools](/Resources/top_schools_module.PNG)

<br />*Top Schools - Adjusted DataFrame*
![adjusted_top-schools](/Resources/top_schools_adjusted.PNG)
While there was a slight decrease in Thomas High School's overall performance, it was not significant enough to change its ranking when viewing all other schools.

* How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
